### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

| Always ready to Contribute to Innovative Projects |

I'm a Flutter Developer who enjoys learning and working on projects. I taught myself Flutter for over a year and even made my own Android app to learn more about it. I've also freelanced on different projects, like creating a unit converter for the Malmath app and a clothing app for a client. Doing these projects made me even more passionate about mobile development.

That's why I decided to do a 6-month internship at Cuesoft, where I worked on real projects. I helped develop a Flutter app for Apparule and the Cueprise HR App. I also worked on other projects, like the Cueprise and Dashboard apps.

I have a strong background in Computer Science and Engineering, and I've taken training courses and studied at University. I'm excited to use my knowledge as a Flutter developer. I'm always learning and ready to help with important projects.
