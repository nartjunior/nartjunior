### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

| Always ready to Contribute to Innovative Projects |

I'm a Mobile App developer who's all about making awesome mobile apps. 

I began my journey with Mobile App and Flutter through self-learning and online courses, eventually building my own Android application.

With over 4 years of experience in software development, I have a strong foundation in various programming languages and frameworks.
My understanding of the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) allows me to create user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.

Now Im using Js frameworks, like React and NextJs to expand my skills and my projects. 

I've also freelanced on different projects, like creating a unit converter for the Malmath app and a clothing app for a client. Doing these projects made me even more passionate about mobile development.

That's why I decided to do a 6-month internship at Cuesoft, where I worked on real projects. I helped develop a Flutter app for Apparule and the Cueprise HR App. I also worked on other projects, like the Cueprise and Dashboard apps.

I have a strong background in Computer Science and Engineering, and I've taken training courses and studied at University. I'm excited to use my knowledge as a Flutter developer. I'm always learning and ready to help with important projects.
